#Memory Game

This is my memory game, the features include:

- Cards on the board are randomly generated from a list, with special attention to make sure the randomisation between the different animal species is relatively even.
- Species mode:
..* The matches in this mode are made by species, but the images may be different
- Exact Match mode: 
..* A match in this mode is only if the image is exactly the same.
- To track your score:
..* time
..* number of moves
..* current score (number of matches)
..* star score (decreases based on the number of moves you have made, compared to the number of cards on the board for that game)
..* number of games won in that session
- You can select the number of cards you wish to be in the new game. This is rounded up to the nearest even number. It is a game of pairs after all.
